The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix", {"entities": [[4652, 4849, "Skills"], [4607, 4611, "Graduation Year"], [4543, 4575, "College Name"], [4499, 4540, "Degree"], [4493, 4497, "Graduation Year"], [4441, 4470, "College Name"], [4410, 4427, "Companies worked at"], [2654, 2671, "Companies worked at"], [2632, 2651, "Designation"], [1323, 1327, "Graduation Year"], [1260, 1277, "Companies worked at"], [1238, 1257, "Designation"], [603, 615, "Companies worked at"], [487, 504, "Companies worked at"], [465, 484, "Designation"], [97, 143, "Email Address"], [53, 66, "Location"], [39, 51, "Companies worked at"], [16, 35, "Designation"], [0, 14, "Name"]]}], ["Imgeeyaul Ansari\njava developer\n\nPune, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4\n\nWilling to relocate to: Pune, Maharashtra\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nApplication Developer\n\nOracle Financial Software Services -  Pune, Maharashtra -\n\nAugust 2016 to Present\n\n\u2022 Wrote Services in java using data annotation which in turn were used for creating other files\nusing code generation tool.\n\n\u2022 Jar of services with related utility files such as DTOs are deployed on the Host side.\n\n\u2022 Host side is hosted on Tomcat Server where proxy files are present.\n\n\u2022 Created jsff page for UI, and wrote action, helper, assembler, backing bean for UI side business\nLogic made entries in collectionAppModule, PageDef.\n\n\u2022 Used ADF & MVC architecture for building application.\n\nUsed JUnit for Testing services,Algorithms.\nAlso made test Suites For running multiple test case at one go.\n\nUsed Eclipse Debugger for Fixing Service Related Jiras.\nMade Use of Hot Deployment for Fixing Ui related Bugs on UI side which was run on Weblogic\nServer. \nUsed JAWS Reader for solving accessibility Related jiras and IA plugin.\n\nUsed Java to write Batches for fetching of Bulk Data at Regular Interval.\nIt created Thread for Multitasking to reduce the time for processing.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Enginerring in Information Technology\n\nArmy institute of technology -  Pune, Maharashtra\n\n2012 to 2016\n\nCBSE in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\n2010 to 2011\n\nCBSE in Mathematics and English\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\n2008 to 2009\n\nSKILLS\n\nJAVA (1 year), CSS (1 year), HTML (1 year), MYSQL (1 year), JAVASCRIPT (Less than 1 year),\nAngularjs (1 year), Oracle Pl/Sql\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\nProgramming Languages :C/C++, angular, java, java servlet, HTML, java script, MySQL, css, jsff.\n\nOperating Systems Linux, Windows, Android\n\nORM Eclipse Link, Hibernate\n\nFramework & tools :ADF, Eclipse, Android Studio, Git, Selenium, Code blocks, Net beans, R studio,\nTortoise SVN.", {"entities": [[1894, 2172, "Skills"], [1726, 1850, "Skills"], [1711, 1715, "Graduation Year"], [1643, 1677, "College Name"], [1610, 1641, "Degree"], [1433, 1467, "College Name"], [1385, 1389, "Graduation Year"], [1359, 1362, "Location"], [1327, 1355, "College Name"], [1276, 1324, "Degree"], [269, 273, "Graduation Year"], [242, 245, "Location"], [204, 237, "Companies worked at"], [181, 201, "Designation"], [145, 148, "Location"], [33, 36, "Location"], [17, 30, "Designation"], [0, 15, "Name"]]}], ["Jay Madhavi\nNavi Mumbai, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Jay-\nMadhavi/1e7d0305af766bf6\n\nI look forward to being associated with a growth - oriented, learning firm and\ncontribute my skills for its success.

INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities.
